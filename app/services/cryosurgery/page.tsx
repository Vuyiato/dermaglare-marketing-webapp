          title: "What is Cryosurgery?",
          content:
            "Cryosurgery involves the controlled application of extreme cold to freeze and destroy targeted tissue. The procedure uses liquid nitrogen (-196°C or -321°F) applied directly to the skin lesion. The extreme cold causes ice crystal formation within cells, leading to cell death and tissue destruction. Blood vessels feeding the lesion are also damaged, cutting off nutrient supply. The frozen tissue forms a blister, then scabs, and eventually falls off naturally. New, healthy skin grows in its place over several weeks. Cryosurgery is one of the oldest and most reliable dermatological procedures, used safely for decades to treat numerous skin conditions effectively.",

          content:
            "Dr. Nkehli uses cryosurgery to treat various dermatological conditions. BENIGN LESIONS: Seborrheic keratoses (age warts), skin tags, dermatosis papulosa nigra, lentigines (age spots/liver spots), and solar lentigines (sun spots). PRECANCEROUS LESIONS: Actinic keratoses (solar keratoses), Bowen's disease (in some cases), and early superficial skin cancers. VIRAL CONDITIONS: Common warts (verruca vulgaris), plantar warts (foot warts), flat warts, and genital warts (in select cases). PEDIATRIC CONDITIONS: Molluscum contagiosum and viral warts in children. OTHER CONDITIONS: Small benign tumors, cherry angiomas, and hypertrophic scars/keloids (as adjunct treatment). Dr. Nkehli will examine your lesion during consultation to determine if cryosurgery is the most appropriate treatment option.",

          title: "The Cryosurgery Procedure",
          content:
            "Cryotherapy is a quick, office-based procedure requiring no surgical preparation. CONSULTATION: Lesion examination and diagnosis confirmation, discussion of treatment expectations, explanation of procedure and healing process, and assessment of any contraindications. PREPARATION: Treatment area cleansed (no anesthesia typically needed), lesion and surrounding area marked if necessary, and protective measures for surrounding healthy skin. APPLICATION METHODS: SPRAY METHOD - Liquid nitrogen sprayed directly onto lesion using a special applicator, precise control of freeze time and depth, and commonly used for larger or multiple lesions. COTTON-TIP APPLICATION - Liquid nitrogen applied with cotton-tipped applicator, more controlled for small, delicate areas, and used for facial lesions or sensitive locations. CRYOPROBE METHOD - Specialized probe applied directly to lesion for very precise treatment and used for certain specific conditions. TREATMENT PARAMETERS: Freeze time varies from 5-60 seconds depending on lesion type and depth, may involve single or multiple freeze-thaw cycles, and sensation described as stinging or burning (tolerable for most patients).",

          title: "What to Expect During Treatment",
          content:
            "Most patients tolerate cryotherapy well without anesthesia. During application, you'll experience intense cold and stinging sensation, burning feeling that intensifies then subsides, and possible throbbing during the freeze cycle. The discomfort typically lasts only during the actual freezing (seconds to a minute). Immediately after treatment, treated area appears white (frozen), thaws and becomes red and swollen, may develop a blister within hours, and mild pain or tenderness is common. The entire procedure, including preparation, usually takes only 5-15 minutes depending on the number and size of lesions being treated.",

          title: "Recovery and Healing Process",
          content:
            "Understanding the healing timeline helps set realistic expectations. IMMEDIATE (0-24 hours): Redness, swelling, and tenderness at treatment site, blister formation (serous or hemorrhagic), and mild discomfort (manageable with over-the-counter pain relief). DAYS 1-7: Blister dries and forms a crust/scab, area may appear dark or black (normal), swelling subsides, and possible oozing if blister breaks (keep clean). WEEKS 1-3: Scab naturally falls off, revealing pink new skin underneath, pigmentation may be lighter or darker temporarily, and gradual return to normal appearance. COMPLETE HEALING: Full healing typically takes 2-6 weeks, pigmentation normalizes over several months, and some lesions may require repeat treatment. DEEPER LESIONS (warts, etc.) may take longer to heal completely, and scarring is usually minimal or absent with proper care.",
        },
        {
          title: "Aftercare Instructions",
          content:
            "Proper aftercare ensures optimal healing and minimizes complications. WOUND CARE: Keep area clean and dry for first 24 hours, gently wash with mild soap after 24 hours, do not pop blisters intentionally (let them break naturally), and apply antibiotic ointment if blister breaks. DO NOT: Pick, scratch, or remove the scab prematurely, apply harsh chemicals or active skincare, expose to direct sun without protection, or submerge in pools/hot tubs until fully healed. PAIN MANAGEMENT: Over-the-counter pain relievers (paracetamol, ibuprofen) for discomfort, cold compress can help with swelling, and elevation if treating lower extremities. SUN PROTECTION: Strict sun protection once healed (SPF 50+), new skin is sensitive to sun damage, and avoid tanning for at least 3 months. MONITORING: Watch for signs of infection (increasing redness, pus, fever), excessive pain or prolonged healing, and contact Dr. Nkehli if concerns arise.",

          content:
            "Cryosurgery success rates are high for appropriate lesions. BENIGN LESIONS (seborrheic keratoses, skin tags): Single treatment success rate 75-95%, lesion typically falls off completely, may leave temporary hypopigmentation, and excellent cosmetic outcomes. WARTS: May require 2-4 treatments spaced 2-3 weeks apart, success rate 60-80% depending on location and type, plantar warts more resistant (may need additional treatments), and patience required as results take weeks. ACTINIC KERATOSES: High clearance rate (85-95%), may require repeat treatment for thicker lesions, reduces skin cancer risk, and regular monitoring important. PIGMENTED LESIONS: Lightens or removes sun spots and age spots, may require multiple treatments for complete clearance, and gradual fading over months. Some lesions may require additional treatments if not completely cleared, which is normal and expected for certain conditions.",

            "Cryotherapy offers numerous benefits compared to other lesion removal methods. MINIMAL INVASIVENESS: No cutting or surgery required, no sutures needed, and minimal to no scarring. QUICK PROCEDURE: Treatment takes only minutes, performed in-office, and no need for operating room. COST-EFFECTIVE: Generally less expensive than surgical excision, no anesthesia costs, and minimal follow-up required. VERSATILE: Can treat multiple lesions in one session, suitable for various skin types, and effective on many body areas. LOW COMPLICATION RATE: Infection risk very low, minimal bleeding, and well-tolerated by most patients. NO DOWNTIME: Return to normal activities immediately, no wound care restrictions in most cases, and suitable for busy lifestyles. For these reasons, cryosurgery is often the first-line treatment for many benign and pre-cancerous skin lesions.",

            "While generally safe, cryotherapy can have side effects. COMMON (Expected): Pain and stinging during treatment, blister formation, temporary redness and swelling, scabbing, and mild scarring (usually minimal). POSSIBLE: Temporary hypopigmentation (lightening) - may be permanent in darker skin, temporary hyperpigmentation (darkening), nerve damage (rare, usually temporary), and hair loss in treated area. RARE: Infection, significant scarring, incomplete lesion removal requiring repeat treatment, and notching or texture changes. CONSIDERATIONS FOR DARKER SKIN: Higher risk of pigment changes, careful technique required, and Dr. Nkehli has expertise in treating all skin types safely. Most side effects are temporary and resolve with healing. Significant complications are rare when performed by an experienced dermatologist like Dr. Nkehli.",
