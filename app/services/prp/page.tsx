          title: "What is PRP Therapy?",
          content:
            "Platelet-Rich Plasma is derived from your own blood through a simple centrifugation process that concentrates platelets to 3-5 times higher than normal blood levels. Platelets contain powerful growth factors including Platelet-Derived Growth Factor (PDGF), Transforming Growth Factor (TGF), Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF), and Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF). These growth factors trigger cellular regeneration, collagen production, tissue repair, and new blood vessel formation. Because PRP uses your own blood, there's no risk of allergic reaction or rejection. This makes it one of the safest regenerative treatments available, suitable for various aesthetic and medical applications.",

          title: "PRP for Facial Rejuvenation (Vampire Facial)",
          content:
            "When combined with micro-needling, PRP creates the popular 'Vampire Facial' treatment that delivers exceptional skin rejuvenation results. The micro-needling creates thousands of micro-channels that allow PRP to penetrate deeply into the dermis. This treatment is highly effective for fine lines and wrinkles, skin texture and tone improvement, enlarged pores, mild scarring and acne marks, overall skin dullness and dehydration, and loss of firmness and elasticity. Results include visibly brighter, plumper skin, improved texture and smoothness, reduction in fine lines, more even skin tone, enhanced skin radiance and glow, and continued improvement over 3-6 months as collagen remodels. Most patients see optimal results after 3 treatments spaced 4-6 weeks apart.",

          title: "PRP for Hair Restoration",
          content:
            "PRP therapy has emerged as a breakthrough treatment for hair loss and thinning hair. When injected into the scalp, growth factors stimulate dormant hair follicles, prolong the growth phase of hair cycles, increase hair follicle size, improve blood supply to follicles, and reduce hair follicle inflammation. PRP is effective for androgenetic alopecia (male and female pattern baldness), alopecia areata (patchy hair loss), telogen effluvium (stress-related hair loss), thinning hair and reduced hair density, and early-stage hair loss (most effective). THE PROCEDURE: Multiple small injections across affected areas of the scalp. Treatment takes 30-45 minutes. Mild discomfort, topical numbing available. RESULTS: Reduced hair shedding within 2-3 months, new hair growth visible at 4-6 months, continued improvement for 9-12 months, and maintenance treatments every 6-12 months. Typically requires 3-4 initial treatments monthly, then maintenance every 6-12 months.",

          content:
            "PRP accelerates healing and improves the appearance of various types of scars including acne scars (particularly effective for rolling and boxcar scars), surgical scars, traumatic injury scars, burn scars, and stretch marks. The growth factors promote collagen remodeling, improve scar texture and color, soften raised scars, and accelerate healing in new scars. Best results achieved when combined with micro-needling or fractional laser treatments. Multiple sessions typically needed for significant improvement (4-6 treatments). PRP can be used preventatively on fresh surgical incisions to promote optimal healing and minimize scarring.",

            "CONSULTATION: Dr. Nkehli assesses your suitability for PRP, discusses realistic expectations, reviews medical history and medications, and develops a customized treatment plan. BLOOD DRAW: Small blood sample taken (similar to routine blood test), typically 10-20ml depending on treatment area. Process takes only a few minutes and is virtually painless. PROCESSING: Blood is placed in a specialized centrifuge, spun at specific speed to separate components, plasma with concentrated platelets is extracted. The entire process takes 10-15 minutes. TREATMENT APPLICATION: FOR FACIAL REJUVENATION - PRP applied during micro-needling, massaged into skin, left on as serum. FOR HAIR RESTORATION - PRP injected into scalp using fine needles, multiple injection points across treatment area. FOR SCAR TREATMENT - PRP applied during micro-needling or injected directly into scars. Treatment time varies: Facial PRP with micro-needling 45-60 minutes, Hair restoration 30-45 minutes, Scar treatment 30-60 minutes depending on area.",

FACIAL PRP: Redness and mild swelling for 24-48 hours, skin may feel tight and sensitive, avoid makeup for 24 hours, and no active skincare for 48 hours. HAIR PRP: Minimal redness at injection sites, slight scalp tenderness for 24 hours, can wash hair after 6-8 hours, and avoid harsh hair products for 48 hours. GENERAL AFTERCARE: Avoid direct sun exposure for 48 hours, use gentle, non-irritating products, stay well hydrated to support healing, avoid alcohol and smoking for 24-48 hours (impairs healing), no strenuous exercise for 24 hours, and apply prescribed post-treatment products. Most patients resume normal activities immediately after treatment.",

FACIAL REJUVENATION: Immediate glow (within 1-2 days), improved texture (2-3 weeks), fine line reduction (4-6 weeks), continued improvement (up to 6 months), and optimal results after series of 3 treatments. HAIR RESTORATION: Reduced shedding (6-8 weeks), new hair growth (3-4 months), increased density (6-9 months), continued improvement (9-12 months), and maintenance needed every 6-12 months. SCAR IMPROVEMENT: Gradual texture improvement (4-8 weeks), color and appearance enhancement (2-3 months), continued remodeling (6-12 months), and multiple sessions needed for best results. Results vary based on individual healing capacity, age and overall health, severity of concern being treated, consistency with treatment protocol, and lifestyle factors (smoking, nutrition, stress).",
